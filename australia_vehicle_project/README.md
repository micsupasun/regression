# Australia Vehicle Project

## Objective
The objective of the Australia Vehicle Project is to develop and evaluate predictive models using machine learning algorithms to predict the prices of vehicles based on various features, such as brand, model, year of manufacture, engine type, and location. The project focuses on analyzing the Australian vehicle market in 2023, with data sourced from various online platforms. The goal is to provide insights into the factors that influence vehicle pricing in Australia and to present these findings in a structured format.
